
You may have noticed using Ascension or any other of your favorite add-ons that there has been less and less working / high quality links. The reason for this is the websites these add-ons pull their links from often do not like Kodi add-ons slamming their websites/free links with traffic and they are often changing how their websites function to fight against this. Therefore the more popular Kodi becomes means more users, and the more users means the more traffic, this will in the future eventually result in Only Subscription based services for links in Kodi add-ons. This time will eventually come and I highly recommend to Subscribe to a Premium service for your links before you get tired of dead/broken links and constant buffering...

All Debrid is a subscription service offering premium (almost private) links to your favorite Kodi add-ons, including Ascension, Elysium, and Bob Unrestricted. The subscription will give you access to a large pool of premium links. These links will help you experience Less Buffering and view Higher Quality links.  You can finally say goodbye to dead / broken links which are often low quality and no more pop-ups asking you to pair to view streams. In Ascension you will notice the Premium links as they show highlighted in Green and they will always be at the Sorted to the top of the links list.
